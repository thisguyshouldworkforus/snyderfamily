# SnyderFamily INT
## Hello World!
This is my first attempt at Ansible.
I hope to use this platform to configure my internal home-lab.  Its stupidly overpowered, overpriced and vastly underutilized ... I love it!

Currently, I configure everything with #BASH Shell scripts -- but that is getting old, and quite tedious.

I'm glad you stumbled upon my slice of the Version Control universe -- any input and/or suggestions on how I may improve what I'm doing here is greatly appreciated!

THANKS!
